                <p>In 2019, Transmission89 joined the founding team of a New York based luxury basics brand acting in a fractional CMO role. While the client had already established their wholesale network, our challenge was to drive eCommerce growth and build their brand online.</p>
                <p>Over the next 18 months, we launched a paid media program across the US, UK and Canada that improved profitability with both new audiences and loyal fans. We increased customer lifetime value through email and marketing automation. We also established a network of engaged micro-influencers that helped build excitement with new audiences and boosted brand recognition.</p>

                <p>Being dissatisfied with their previous marketing agency, a leading medical education platform was looking for a fresh approach to their digital advertising program, in an effort to increase their return on ad spend (ROAS) and drive revenue growth.</p>
                <p>Alongside a paid search specialist, we audited and optimized Google and Bing campaigns for more than 160 products, finding opportunities to reduce wasted ad spend and maximize returns through A/B testing. In addition we layered on new campaigns in YouTube to help them leverage short form video for added reach and engagement with their niche audiences.</p>
